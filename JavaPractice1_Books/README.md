You will be managing your own book collection feel free to add more books or functionality if you'd like. You should be able to read a book, you should be able to print out the array of books you've read. Should handle input whether correctly capitalized or not.

EXAMPLE:  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read: r  
[H]arry Potter, [D]on Quixote, [T]he Inferno, [P]aradise Lost: T  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read: V  
[The Inferno]  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read: R  
[H]arry Potter, [D]on Quixote, [T]he Inferno, [P]aradise Lost: h  
[S]orcerer's Stone, [C]hamber of Secrets, [P]risoner of Azkaban, [G]oblet of Fire: G  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read: v  
[The Inferno, Goblet of Fire]

If you want a little extra challenge add the ability to add new books through inputs
and still be able to have them show up in the read and view sections like:  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read, [A]dd new book: A  
Title: New Book  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read, [A]dd new book: r  
[H]arry Potter, [D]on Quixote, [T]he Inferno, [P]aradise Lost, [N]ew Book: n  
[R]ead a book, [V]iew books you've read: V  
[New Book]
